# SharpSight
Lightweight C# computer vision library 

SharpSight aims to be a small but full of features, computer vision and image processing library for c#.  
I aim at minimal outside dependencies, while maintaining support for all the necessary mathematical,  
statistical and physical backbone.

Roadmap:  
  
v.1  
Mathematical data types (Matrix, vector, quaternion, etc)  
Numerical analysis functions (prerequisits to matrix inversion)  
Basic pinhole camera model
